# Agent-Based Ping Detection & Security Monitoring Using Elastic Cloud

## Overview
This project demonstrates the deployment and configuration of Elastic Security on Elastic Cloud to monitor Linux endpoints and detect suspicious network activity. It focuses on ICMP (ping) traffic monitoring and security alert generation for SOC operations.

## Key Features
- Deploys Elastic Agents via Fleet for endpoint monitoring.
- Configures custom detection rules for ICMP traffic anomalies.
- Monitors network activity and generates security alerts.
- Supports practical SOC workflows and incident response analysis.
